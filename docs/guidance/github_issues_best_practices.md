# GitHub Issues Best Practices

Issues help track tasks on GitHub.

## 🆕 New Issues

- Search for similar issue before creating a new issue. 
- Comment on an existing issue rather than creating a duplicate issue.
- Use brief but descriptive titles and avoid vague titles like 'Documentation'.
- Provide as much useful detail as possible in the issue comment section.

## 📐 Issue Templates

- Create pre-filled issue templates to guide contributors and help them create useful issues. 
- Create templates for different categories if necessary.

## 🏷 Issue Labels

Use the following default labels within your workflow:

Label | Description
--- | ---
`bug` | 'bugs' or unexpected behaviour or problems
`good first issue` | people new to the project can work on this
`wontfix` | won't be worked on
`documentation` | adding or improving documentation
