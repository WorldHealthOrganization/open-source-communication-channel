## ü§î What is Open Source? 

The term ‚ÄúOpen Source‚Äù refers to Open Source software, which is code designed to be publicly accessible by anyone to study, use, modify and distribute. 

Historically, most software was ‚Äúfree and open‚Äù in the sense that it was developed by computer science academics and corporate researchers working together and distributing results under the principles of transparency, sharing and co-operation. However, the late 1960‚Äôs and especially the development of personal computers brought new opportunities to define a separate market for software: Since software is covered by copyright, which along with contract law provides a legal basis for its owner to establish exclusive rights, these rights were assigned or licensed under individual terms depending on the underlying business model. Consequently, hardware and software components were sold separately and under different conditions, whereby software was usually sold and distributed in ‚Äúobject code‚Äù format only, which is difficult for humans to understand, analyze or modify.

While this distinction between human-readable source code and machine-readable object code reflects a legitimate business model, some critics have argued that users should be able to study and change the software in use, e.g. to remove malicious elements or identify and address security issues, without having to rely on updates and support from respective software vendors. Hence, the main goal for the Free Software software approach is **not** to make software available free of charge but **free of legal constraints** that restrict studying and modifying software. In order to assure availability without restraints upon modification and redistribution, Free Software is released under public licenses reflecting the following four freedoms (see https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

While the general idea of Free Software was very successful, the terminology was difficult to be adopted by the corporate sector. Because the English language does not differentiate between low price and liberty (or gratis and libre in other languages), the term Free Software invariably required further explanation. As a result of the debate with the corporate world, the term Open Source software was suggested as an alternative and as a strategic decision to ‚Äúpromote the idea of Free Software to business people‚Äù (see https://www.theregister.com/2018/02/03/open_source_turns_20/). Like the Free Software advocates, supporters of the Open Source software concept establshied a set of criteria for licensing terms to qualify as Open Source conformant, see OSI definition available at https://opensource.org/osd/.

Even if both terms and definitions exist in parallel, the ultimate goal of both the Free Software advocates and the Open Source Software supporters remains the same: Software should be available under legal terms that allow and facilitate studying, modifying and further distributing the software.
