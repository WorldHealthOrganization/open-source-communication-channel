# Starting an Open Source Project

This document provides some quick pointers as you plan to make your work publicly available under and Open Source license.

## How to start an Open Source project: Best Practices

GitHub's [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) provides an easy to follow checklist to help you if you want to open source your project:

### Documentation

âœ” GitHub repository - the [WHO has adopted GitHub](new_github_repo.md) as the standard code repository for software projects

âœ” License - add a LICENSE file containing your chosen open source license to your project

âœ” Basic documentation - add [README](sample_readme.md), CONTRIBUTING, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files to guide people who want to know more about the project and perhaps contribute to it

### Code

âœ” Conventions and best practices - use consistent code conventions and practices to make your work easily maintainable 

âœ” Continuous documentation - add code comments or inline documentation

> ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** If you wanted to contribute to an open source project, what practices would make it easier for you? Apply the same to encourage your community to contribute to your work.

### Community and Collaboration

âœ” Promote your project internally and externally

âœ” Assign a community manager to handle interaction with your community
