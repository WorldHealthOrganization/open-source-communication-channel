# Setting up a GitHub Repository

## 🤔 What is GitHub?

GitHub offers products for storing and collaborating on source code.

The World Health Organization's verified GitHub organisation can be viewed at [github.com/WorldHealthOrganization](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization).

> 📖 **Read more:** [about enterprise accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts).

## 👤 Creating a GitHub Personal User Account

A personal GitHub account is needed to contribute code, open issues, or participate in discussion on GitHub repositories. 

Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for a personal GitHub account using your email.

> ℹ **Note:** You can use your personal email address together with your work email, especially if you would like to maintain a history of your GitHub activity beyond your current organization.

### Two-factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an important layer of protection to make your account more secure.

### Link to WHO WIMS Account

For WHO members, you may require an additional step to link your GitHub account using single sign on. See [instructions](https://extranet.who.int/confluence/display/github/GitHub+Standards).

> ℹ **Note:** Collaborators without a WHO account can still be invited as collaborators.

## ⚙ Requesting a WHO GitHub Repository

WHO members can request a new repository using the [self service portal](https://who.service-now.com/self_service?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=87bc6f40db1c9090a10ba7c748961988).

### Repository Best Practices

- Use lower case words connected with hyphens for your repository name
- The repository name should be short but descriptive (<50 characters)
- Avoid special characters or spaces in a repository name
- Add a brief description of the purpose for the repository
- Add [topics](https://github.blog/2017-01-31-introducing-topics/) to your repository details
