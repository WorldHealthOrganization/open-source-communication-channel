# Setting up a GitHub Repository

## What is GitHub?

GitHub offers products for storing and collaborating on code.

The World Health Organization has a GitHub Enterprise account that can be viewed at [github.com/WorldHealthOrganization](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization).

Read [more about enterprise accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts).

## Creating a GitHub User Account

A GitHub account is needed to contribute code, open issues, or participate in discussion on GitHub repositories. 

Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for a GitHub account using your email.

> ℹ **Note:** You can use your personal email address, especially if you would like to maintain a history of your GitHub activity beyond your current organization.

### Two-factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an important layer of protection to make your account more secure.

Follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on enabling 2FA.

### Link to WHO WIMS account

For WHO members, you may require an additional step to link your GitHub account using single sign on. See (instructions)[https://extranet.who.int/confluence/display/github/GitHub+Standards].

> ℹ **Note:** Collaborators without a WHO account can still be invited as collaborators.

### Requesting a WHO GitHub Repository

WHO members can request a new repository using the [self service portal](https://who.service-now.com/self_service?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=87bc6f40db1c9090a10ba7c748961988).


### Repository Best Practices

- Use lower case words connected with hyphens for your repository name
- The repository name should be short but descriptive (<50 characters)
- Avoid special characters or spaces in a repository name
- Add a brief description of the purpose for the repository
- Add [topics](https://github.blog/2017-01-31-introducing-topics/) to your repository details
