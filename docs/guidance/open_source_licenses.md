# Open Source Licenses

## ðŸ“„ Open Source Licenses 

> â„¹ **Note:** A project becomes Open Source once an **Open Source license is applied** to it, and the source code is made **available to the public**.

As per definition, all Open Source licenses require that the respective source code must be publicly available and that modification must be allowed. However, a detailed look into the terms of different Open Source licenses reveals that they can be devided into different categories: 
- Copyleft licenses require further licensees, who modify the software, to make such modifi-cations available under the same terms under which the original software was released with-out any further restrictions.
- Permissive licences give the user the flexibility in the sense that they do not restrict the use of the software and do not impose any conditions as to which the software itself or any modification have to be used or subsequently licensed.  Consequently software licensed under a permissive license may be modified and distributed under any license including a non open source license for example a proprietary license. 

Popular Copyleft licenses include
- [GNU General Public License version 2.1]
- [GNU General Public License version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

Popular permissive licenses include
- [BSD License] 
- [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/)
- [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/license.html)

> â„¹ **Note:** Not all open source licenses are copyleft.
