# Why Build Contributor Communities and Where to Start

## 🤔 What is an Open Source Community?

Open source communities are made up of users, contributors, and maintainers.

- *Users* are those who use the software but are not submitting code or documentation. The may sometimes submit support issues.
- *Contributors* are those who are submitting code or documentation but need someone to review their code and merge their contribution. They do not have permission to merge their own changes.
- *Maintainers* are those who review and merge contributions from contributos. They have permission to merge changes.

It is recommended that open source projects within the WHO have one or both of the following in place:

- *Technical Committee* - a group of maintainers with the required technical expertise to prioritize things on the project roadmap and resolve disputes
- *Product Lead* - a person who sets the objectives of the project and communicates them clearly to the community 

## 🤷🏽‍♀️ Why Build a Community?

A community of active contributors and maintainers builds the projects reputation and is a fundamental block in sustaining the project.

Through contributor communities, the organization can leverage a wider pool of expertise and collaborate in ways that would be complicated with proprietary projects.

## 📃 Community Checklist

Have the following in place as you set up your community:

✔ A [README](sample_readme.md) that provides a clear overview of the project, what it does, and its various components

✔ A community [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/open-source-communication-channel/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ':target=_blank') that clearly outlines the dos and don'ts of building a friendly and inclusive community

> ℹ **Reference:** [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
