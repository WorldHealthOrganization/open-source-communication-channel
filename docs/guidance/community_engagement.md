# Community Engagement Tools and Best Practices

## 🔍 Overview

Keeping your community engaged is important if you want to keep contributions coming. Contributors are more likely to join a community that is well engaged and responsive. There are various ways to engage your community.

## 🧩 Community Platforms

### Choosing a Community Platform

There are many options to choose from when it comes to community platforms. Two recommended platforms are:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) takes the least effort to setup if your project repository is on GitHub.
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is an open source platform that provides various features for community discussions and tools for moderation. 

> ℹ **Note:** For WHO projects, reach out to the WHO OSPO or IMT if you would like support setting up your community platform.

### Managing your Community Platform

Your community needs to be a safe, inclusive, and inviting space for everyone to participate. Every community should have someone or a group of people who take on the role of a community manager. The community manager should:

- monitor the community platform to ensure everyone is following the code of conduct 
- take appropriate action when the code is broken, or escalate matters to a governance committee for appropriate action and resolution
- ensure response times are kept reasonably low to encourage participation and engagement
- help keep the community platform well organized to make it easy for people to use, for example, by maintaining a clear list of discussion categories and provide guidance on how to post
- promote engagement on the community platform by encouraging people to post or by posting what they have heard from people

## 📅 Community Events

Community events are a good way to drive engagement. Both in-person and online events provide an opportunity for community members to get to know one another and promote a sense belonging.

- As much as possible, plan consistent community events to keep your community engaged. These can be monthly, quarterly, or every 6 months.
- Maintain a public community calendar or list with upcoming events to help your community members plan attendance in advance.
- Have a code of conduct for community events just as you have one for your community platform.
- Use community events as an opportunity to hear other voices besides the project leaders and maintainers, for example, invite contributors and users to share their stories, painpoints, or ideas.
