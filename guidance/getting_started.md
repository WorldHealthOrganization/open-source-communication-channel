# Getting Started with Open Source at WHO

This document provides some quick pointers on what you need to know as you plan to open source your work or use open source technologies.

## ðŸ¤” What is Open Source? 

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) provides [criteria](https://opensource.org/osd) for open source works. These include free distribution, publicly available source code, permitting derived works, and non-discrimination against people, fields or other software.

<br>

> â„¹ **Note:** A project becomes open source once an open source licenses is applied to it and the source code or source material is made available to the public.

<br>

GitHub's [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) provides an easy to follow checklist to help you if you want to open source your project:

#### Documentation

âœ” GitHub repository - WHO has adopted GitHub as the standard code repository for software projects

âœ” License - add a LICENSE file containing your chosen open source license to your project

âœ” Basic documentation - add README, CONTRIBUTING, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files to guide people who want to know more about the project and perhaps contribute to it

#### Code

âœ” Conventions and best practices - use consistent code conventions and practices to make your work easily maintainable 

âœ” Continuous documentation - add code comments or inline documentation

<br>

> ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** If you wanted to contribute to an open source project, what would make it easier for you?

<br>

#### Community and Collaboration

âœ” Promote your project internally and externally

âœ” Assign a community manager to handle interaction with your community

<br>

## Open Source Licenses 

Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the open source definition, allowing software to be freely used, modified, and shared.

### Copyleft 

[Copyleft](https://opensource.org/faq#copyleft) refers to licenses that allow derivative works but require them to use the same license as the original work. GPL, AGPL, and Mozilla Public License 2.0 are examples of copyleft licenses.

<br>

> â„¹ **Note:** Derived works of copyleft licenses work must be made available with compatible copyleft license.

<br>

### Permissive Open Source License 

A permissive license guarantees freedom to use, modify, and redistribute, but permits proprietary derivative works.

<br>

> â„¹ **Note:** Not all open source licenses are copyleft.
